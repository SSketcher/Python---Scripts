# Logistic map visualisation
## General info
Highly influenced by [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk), I attempted to visualize Logistic map.

>The logistic map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations.
