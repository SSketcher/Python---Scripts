# Python---Scripts
This folder contain two scripts, for doing one-time pad encryption on .text files, and on images.

>In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires >the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent. In this >technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each >bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character >from the pad using modular addition. If the key is truly random, at least as long as the plaintext, never >reused in whole or in part, and kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible >to decrypt or break.
